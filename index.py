#Exercise 1 - Write a Python class for an Animal that has a name and energy attributes. The animal class should also have methods for eat, sleep, and play that will take in an integer and increase/decrease the energy of the animal with a formatted print statement

# Example 1
# buddy = Animal('Buddy', 10)
# buddy.play(5) -> "Buddy is playing for 5 minutes. His energy is now 5"
# buddy.sleep(10) -> "Buddy is sleeping for 10 minutes. His energy is now 15"

class Animal:
    energy = 100
    name = buddy

def __eat__(name,):
    print(f"{name} is at {energy}level"):

def __sleep__(name):
    print(f"{name} is sleeping"):

def __play__(name):
    print(f"{name} is playing"):



#Exercise 2 - Turn the shopping cart program into an object-oriented program
# Create a class called cart that retains items and has methods to add, remove, and show


class Cart:
 
   list = []

   print input("what would you like to purchase"):
   print input.remove = ("remove"):
  
   
   def __add__(name,item,price):
        if item == ("add"):
        list.append and print(f"{item} added and {price}"):

    def __remove__(item):
        if item == item and input == "remove"
        item.remove from list:
        print(f"item removed"):
        
    def __show__(item,price):
        print(f"{item} + {list}"):
        print(f"Total = {price}"):
